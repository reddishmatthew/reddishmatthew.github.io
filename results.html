								<h3>Training Results</h3>
								<h4>ResNet Results</h4>
								<p>
									Below represents the increase of accuracy and decrease of loss in the ResNet model. As we can see 
									the loss in training starts off high above 3, which is to be expected in initial training. What is great 
									to see is the loss decreasing below 1 after this first epoch and steadily decreasing closer to zero over the
									rest. The validation follows the same suit, where from epoch 4 and higher the loss seems to be only slightly 
									higher than the training set. 
								</p>

								<p class="align-center" style="font-size: 12px;">Epoch vs. Loss for Training and Validation in ResNet.</p>
								<p>
									We see the inverse happening with accuracy, where the training set of data approaches near perfect accuracy by the final epoch.
									The validation set follows the training accuracy initially, but we see a drop in validation accuracy after the 4th epoch. For 
									the rest of the epochs the validation accuracy dances between 94% and 97%, an accuracy that can still be praised. 
								</p>
								<img class="align-center" src="images/epoch_v_accuracy_resnet.png" alt="" style="max-width: 35%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; border: 2px solid #ccc; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"/>
								<p class="align-center" style="font-size: 12px;">Epoch vs. Accuracy for Training and Validation in ResNet.</p>
								<h4>U-Net Results</h4>
								<p>
									U-Net has strong values for both training and validation loss and accuracy. Unlike ResNet, which had more than 10 epochs, U-Net was setup 
									with 4. This, however, did not prove adverse to it's success as the training loss had decreased from ~0.48 to ~0.24. The validation set 
									had an improvement over the training set where it's loss decreased from ~0.36 to ~0.21.
								</p>
								<img class="align-center" src="images/epoch_v_loss.png" alt="" style="max-width: 35%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; border: 2px solid #ccc; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"/>
								<p class="align-center" style="font-size: 12px;">Epoch vs. Loss for Training and Validation in U-Net.</p>
								<p>
									Accuracy saw the same great results. The training set had increased it's accuracy from ~78% to ~90% after the four 
									epochs. The validation set again improved upon the training set and increased from ~81% to ~91%. 
								</p>
								<img class="align-center" src="images/epoch_v_accuracy.png" alt="" style="max-width: 35%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; border: 2px solid #ccc; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);"/>
								<p class="align-center" style="font-size: 12px;">Epoch vs. Accuracy for Training and Validation in U-Net.</p>
								<p>
									This then can be improved further on future iterations with changes to epoch amount, learning rate, batch size, and 
									the size of training and validation sets. These models can already be seen to be powerfully accurate in determining 
									the correct diagnosis. With increased use, the models will improve and accuracy will plateau closer to near perfection.
								</p>
								<h3>Prediction Results</h3>
								<p>
									It is then interesting to see, "What is the diagnosis of this image?" when we know the correct disease label. We found that 
									the model can correctly distinguish the classification. If the classification is not non-tumorous, the program can accurately 
									estimate the size of the tumor by pixels within the image and then use such information to estimate the relative size of the tumor 
									compared to the size of the brain in percentage. Followed by the segmentation mask created by U-Net and the original image. Below is
									the example you may recognize from the Process page.
