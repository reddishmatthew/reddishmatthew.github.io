							<h3>The Vision and The Potential</h3>
							<p>
								As you can see, U-Net and ResNet are powerful tools capable of segmenting and diagnosing medical images. 
								In our case, for brain MRI images. By combining their forces we are able to locate, label, describe the size of,
								and visualize the disease of the patient. Our accuracy and loss proved to have strong end values, while still
								having some room for improvement. With changes to the inputs and more rigorous training, these values can become
								near-perfect and establish these models as trustworthy diagnosis tools. 
							</p>
							<p>
								However, after reading the process of using these CNN models it is clear that it can be complicated if not time consuming.
								If these tools are to be used in the professional field, someone with knowledge of these systems would be needed. 
								Doctors and nurses are incredibly intelligent to their field, but may not have the needed programming experience to run 
								these tools. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore, in addition to multi-tasking CNN using U-Net and ResNet, we have created an API to reduce the hefty process 
								down to a simple image (or a batch of images) upload. This became our main goal, to bring a user-friendly interface that 
								can broaden the client base. Open the possibilities for using the powerful CNN models from those that specialize in the field 
								to those that have no prior experience. 
							</p>
							<p>
								While the API is currently registered to identify the three types of tumors we have mentioned, the potential for 
								this system is grand. The labels and input images can be changed, allowing for any source of medical images and 
								diagnoses desired. On an extreme scale with enough development, it could be developed to handle all forms of images 
								and diseases at once. To change these parameters now would mean to reprogram the code, but even this could become 
								user-friendly where the user can input all that the API would need to know and return exactly what is needed.
							</p>
							<h3>Last Note</h3>
							<p>
								To run this API yourself, head to our GitHub link either by the main page mini post or by clicking the 'GitHub'
								button in the list on the top right of the page and follow the instructions listed.

								Thank you!
